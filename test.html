            <h3>Title</h3>
            <p>Tasks:
                1. Workshop Header: <BR>
                Develop a header section for the web page. <br>
                Include the workshop's name: “Health CodeX Workshop 2023”.
                Add an image or logo related to health coding and messaging at the top of the page. You can design a simple logo or use royalty-free images available online.</p>
                
                <p>2. Venue Information & Call for Abstracts: <br>
                List the venue details where the workshop will be held, including the address, contact number, and facilities.
                Include a section inviting professionals and students to submit abstracts for the workshop. Provide submission guidelines and deadlines.</p>
                
                3. Workshop Program Link:<br>
                Insert a hyperlink leading to a separate page containing the workshop’s program.
                On the program page, include a table listing various talks and sessions planned for the workshop. Invent names and details for talks focusing on different coding and classification systems for medical data (such as SNOMED, ICD-9, ICD-10-AM, Read, ICPC, DICOM) and messaging standards (FHIR, HL7, Continua Alliance, ISO/IEEE 11073).<br>
                
                4. Plenary Sessions Details:<br>
                Include in the program details of two plenary sessions. One session should focus on the coding and classification of medical information using ICD-10-AM, and the other on health messaging and standards using HL7.
                Provide links next to each plenary session that leads to additional information pages.
                On these linked pages, write several paragraphs describing HL7 and ICD-10/ICD-10-AM. Ensure the information provided is accurate and clear. This will require you to conduct research and present the information in your own words, as your understanding of this material is part of the course curriculum and will be assessed
